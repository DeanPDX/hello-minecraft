Before you start
----------------------------------
First thing, a provisioning build of your project will start. This will happen automatically after the project is 
created. This build will take between 5 and 20 minutes depending on your Internet connection. The following builds 
will only build your source code and will be much faster.

Note: During the first time build, Java Intellisense and Browsing services will not be available. After the
build completes, make sure you reopen any .java documents in the editor

Running the mod
----------------------------------
The template created an example mod. To see it running, just press F5. 
Happy coding!

Launching the server
-----------------------------------
The template created a special configuration called "DebugServer" that launches the Minecraft server and loads your mod.
To get the server running though, you will first need to accept the Minecraft EULA. Read eula.txt for more details (this 
file gets created after the first failed server launch). 

Updating jar references
-----------------------------------
If the build process complains about missing packages or you accidentally removed any jar references from your project
you can "reprovision" your project by opening "Package Manager Console" under Tools > NuGet Package Manager menu and run 
the following commands:

PM> $project = get-project "ProjectName" # Make sure the project name matches
PM> $dte.ExecuteCommand("CustomCommands.ProvisionMinecraftProject", $project.UniqueName)
